N.B :
 - BEFORE UPDATING TO THE LATEST VERSION, WE WOULD HIGHLY APPRECIATE IF YOU KEEP A 	BACKUP OF THE EXISTING VERSION.

Let's proceed,

- Move to the section 'Update Product' on that page
- Upload the file 'update_5.0.zip' which is located at update_pack > version-5.0 folder inside your copy of Academy app downloaded from Codecanyon.
- Hit the button 'Update'.
- That's it
